# Snowdroid Reborn
**Snowdroid Reborn** - an independent operating system built on top of AOSP, the goal of which is to provide the greatest possible support for devices that are _poorly supported_ by device manufacturers.

It is the successor to the [original project](https://github.com/SnowDroid) created by John Ott.
